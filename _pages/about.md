Hey there, welcome to my homepage!! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UNC Charlotte. I am exploring how AI techniques can revolutionize robotics and computer vision by enabling the monitoring of human movement disorders without the need for motion capture laboratories (MoCap).
I received my double Mastersâ€™s degrees in computer science and chemistry from East Carolina University University. During my time at ECU, I had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Paul Gemperline](https://chemistry.ecu.edu/faculty-staff/gemperlinep/) and [Dr. Nasseh Tabrizi](https://cet.ecu.edu/csci/about-us/faculty-staff/tabrizi/) on research focusing on AI, machine learning techniques, and tensor decomposition methods to identify genes significantly associated with colon cancer susceptibility. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, tennis, photography, and spending time with my family and friends.
